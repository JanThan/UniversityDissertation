# University Dissertation

My final year of university involved a heightened review of intelligent machines.  
As such, I became interested in machine learning like much of the world and spent a majority of time building models to complete tasks.  
Building on this, I decided to dedicate [my final year dissertation](https://github.com/JanThan/UniversityDissertation/blob/main/Final%20Year%20Dissertation.pdf) to the topic of adversarial attacks on object detection systems commonly used across multiple industries.  
It focuses on the topic of building a robust CNN (object detection system) which is resistant to adversarial attacks using researched methods.
